#🔍 Face Recognition App
##📌 Overview

This project utilizes machine learning to classify and identify faces from images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model accurately determines who the person in the image is from a predefined set of individuals.

##🚀 Features
✅ Deep Learning Model: Trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate face recognition.
✅ Web App Interface: Built with Flask for an interactive experience.
✅ Image Processing: Preprocesses images, including resizing, normalization, and feature extraction.
✅ Real-Time Predictions: Users can upload an image to get instant recognition results.

##📊 Tech Stack
🖥 Backend: Python, Flask, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV
🎨 Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
📂 Database: Pre-collected labeled image dataset (stored in directories)
🚀 Deployment: Flask (Localhost or Cloud)
