# Image-Classification

📌 Overview

This project utilizes machine learning to classify and identify faces from images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model accurately determines who the person in the image is from a predefined set of individuals.


🚀 Features

Deep Learning Model: Trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate face recognition.
Web App Interface: Built with Flask for an interactive experience.
Image Processing: Preprocesses images, including resizing, normalization, and feature extraction.
Real-Time Predictions: Users can upload an image to get instant recognition results.




📊 Tech Stack

🖥 Backend: Python, Flask, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV

🎨 Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

📂 Database: Pre-collected labeled image dataset (stored in directories)

🚀 Deployment: Flask (Localhost or Cloud)
